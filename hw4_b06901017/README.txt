※Purpose of these programs:
The first one is to solve shortest path problem through dynamic programming(Dijkstra's algorithm) by C++.
The second one is to solve the maximum subarray problem also through dynamic programming(Kadane's algorithm) by Prolog.

※How to compile and execute:
For the first one:
1.Put the input file into HW04_b06901017 folder and rewrite the input file name in hw4.cpp line 27.
2.Press F11 and wait for seconds.
3.Find result.cpp in HW04_b06901017 folder and check the answer.
For the second one:
1.Open msp.pl.
2.Type in maxsum([......],X). (......is your input list and don't forget the period)
3.Press enter and you would see the ansewer.
